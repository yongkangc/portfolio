## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

Currently I am working with [Chainlink Labs](https://chain.link/) to scale Chainlink services across multiple blockchains like Ethereum, Solana and Cosmos.

I am also sourcing amazing web3 startups for [Spartan Group](https://www.spartangroup.io/) which is a leading venture capital firm in the Web3 space. Feel free to reach out!

I believe that blockchain and distributed systems are forging a transparent and secure decentralized future, challenging centralized power and corruption.

## Background

Previously I have had the privilege of working with some of the most respected companies in the Web3 space:

- [Spartan Labs](https://www.spartangroup.io/): Led smart contract projects and [thought leadership articles](https://medium.com/@spartanlabs).
- [Nethermind](https://www.nethermind.io/): Security tooling using Forta Bots
- [StraitsX](https://straitsx.com/): Stablecoin infra dev, optimizing performance and reliability.
- [Velodrome](https://velodrome.finance/): Core smart contract dev for #1 Defi App on Optimism
- [Treehouse Finance](https://www.treehouse.finance/): Innovated on DeFi analytics, working with smart contracts and on-chain data aggregation.
