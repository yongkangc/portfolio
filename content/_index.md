## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

Currently doing performance engineering for [Reth](https://reth.rs/) at [Tempo](https://tempo.xyz/) (acquired) to make it the most performant execution client in EVM land.

I'm passionate about building non-hierarchical systems with blockchain and distributed systems. Rust is my language of choice - it's the best way to build software that's both performant and safe without compromise. I share my thoughts on software development in my [articles](/articles).

Currently diving deep into building my own arb bots.

## Open Source
