## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

Currently doing performance engineering for [Reth](https://reth.rs/) to make it the most performant node in EVM land.

I'm passionate about building non-hierarchical systems with blockchain and distributed systems. Love building in Rust and contributing to open source 🦀 I share my thoughts on software development in my [articles](/articles).

Currently diving deep into building my own arb bots.

## Background

Previously I have had the privilege of working with some of the most respected companies in the Web3 space:

- [Chainlink Labs](https://chain.link/): Scaling Chainlink oracles and keepers across multiple blockchains including Ethereum, Solana and Aptos.

- [Spartan Labs](https://www.spartangroup.io/): Led smart contract projects and [thought leadership articles](https://medium.com/@spartanlabs).
- [Nethermind](https://www.nethermind.io/): Security tooling for top protocols like Aave using Forta Bots
