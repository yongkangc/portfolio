## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/avatar.jpg" alt="avatar">}}

Currently deep in the Solana trenches building out low latency infrastructure for [Ranger Finance](https://www.ranger.finance) - Solana's first perpetuals aggregator.

Previously I was working with [Chainlink Labs](https://chain.link/) to scale Chainlink products across multiple blockchains including Ethereum, Solana and Aptos.

Building Non-Hierachical Systems with Blockchain & Distributed Systems. I love building in rust 🦀 currently diving deep into svm and agentic software.

## Background

Previously I have had the privilege of working with some of the most respected companies in the Web3 space:

- [tETH](https://docs.treehouse.finance/protocol/teth/introduction): Architected and led the development of tETH, a Liquid Staking Token that aggregates ETH yield, surpassing $200 million TVL on Ethereum.
- [Spartan Labs](https://www.spartangroup.io/): Led smart contract projects and [thought leadership articles](https://medium.com/@spartanlabs).
- [Nethermind](https://www.nethermind.io/): Security tooling using Forta Bots
- [StraitsX](https://straitsx.com/): Stablecoin infra dev, optimizing performance and reliability.
- [Velodrome](https://velodrome.finance/): Core smart contract dev for #1 Defi App on Optimism
